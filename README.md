# Module 13: Mapping Earthquakes with JS & APIs

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose
To improve the earthquake map, the location of the tectonic plates as well as all major earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 will be displayed on the map. Toggles will be implemented to allow these datasets to be switched on or off. Additionally, a third map tile layer will be created and can be selected using the radio buttons.  

### Resources
* Visual Studio Code, JavaScript, HTML
* Leaflet CSS Library, D3.js
* Mapbox API
